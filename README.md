# water_potability_prediction


## Overview
Water potability refers to the safety of water for human consumption and is free from harmful contaminants and bacteria i.e., water that can be used for drinking or cooking. The World Health Organization(WHO) considers access to safe drinking water as a basic human right. Filtration and treatment processes such as UV filtration and reverse osmosis are some of the various methods that can be used to ensure water potability. In developed countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards although only a small proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation. If concerns about the potability of wate arise, it can be tested by a professional laboratory. A water potability test is a crucial evaluation of water quality that determines its suitability for human consumption.
